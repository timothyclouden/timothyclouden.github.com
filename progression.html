	<h2>The Progession of HBCU's</h2>
	
	<div id= "prog">
	
	<h3>The First Historically Black College: Cheyney Univeristy (1837)</h3>
		<img src= "images/cheyney.jpg"  width= "200" height="150">
	<p>     Founded in Cheyney, Pennsylvania in 1837, by Richard Humphries who left funds in his will to establish a school for African Americans. Originally called the "Institute for Colored Youth" in order to provide elementry and secondary education for freed slaves, in order to prepare them for their careers as professionals.</p>

	<h3>Post-Civil War (1865-1900)</h3>
	<p>     With the help of abolitionist and philantropic support, many other HBCUs were founded during this time. They were committed to providing educational support to American Americans and provided financial support. Education was recognized as the pathway to economic and social advancement, in order to grow their community, this lead to the desire to be educated and these schools became the center of learning, leadership, and development.</p>

	<h3>Challenges (Late 1900s)</h3>
	<p>     While these HBCUs were provided financial help, they were still not nearly as funded as a Prodominately White School (PWI). HBCUs also had infrastucture issues, with limiteed resources and inadequate facilities, this impacted the student experience and led to an enrollment decline or lower graduation rates. </p>
	<p>Despite these challenges, many HBCUs continued to excel academically and contribute significantly to their communities. Overcoming these obstacles often required creative solutions, increased advocacy for funding, and strategic planning to ensure the long-term sustainability and success of these important institutions.</p>

	<h3>Recognition and Ongoing Impact (Early 2000s-Today)</h3>
	<p>NOw with a blend of traditions, culture, and educational experiences, Historically Black Colleges and Universities finally had their own identity. Students, faculty, and staff garndered close-knit relationships and giving them a palpable sense of community. Beyond the classroom there was a homey atmosphere. With events such as homecomings, step shows and cultural festivals, African Americans were now celebrated, these events showcased music, dance, and art all rooted in the African American experience. Students began to flourish and exelled in a variety of fields such as, politics, arts, and sciences. HBCU campuses became a place to get your voice out, students tend to engage in talk about equality, civil rights, and diversity. HBCUs served as more than just educational institutions. They were centers of community life, culture, and identity, providing not only education but also a sense of belonging and empowerment.</p>
<p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) continue to play a crucial role in shaping the educational landscape for Black scholars today. These institutions provide a supportive and nurturing environment where students often find a sense of belonging and community that may be lacking in mainstream institutions. HBCUs have been instrumental in fostering academic excellence and cultivating leaders across various fields, including science, technology, business, arts, and humanities.

One significant impact of HBCUs on Black scholars is the empowerment they offer through education. HBCUs strive to address historical educational disparities by providing quality education to Black students and preparing them for successful careers. The impact extends beyond the classroom, as HBCUs often prioritize mentorship, creating a network of support that guides students through their academic journey and into their professional lives.

Furthermore, HBCUs contribute significantly to the development of a diverse workforce. By offering opportunities for higher education to individuals who might face systemic barriers elsewhere, these institutions help bridge the racial gap in various professions. Graduates of HBCUs often go on to become leaders, influencers, and trailblazers in their respective fields, making a lasting impact on society and challenging stereotypes.

HBCUs also serve as incubators for cultural awareness, social justice advocacy, and community engagement. Through a curriculum that acknowledges the historical and cultural contributions of African Americans, HBCUs empower students to embrace their identity and become advocates for positive change. The emphasis on social responsibility prepares Black scholars to address contemporary challenges and contribute meaningfully to the ongoing fight for equity and justice.

In summary, HBCUs today continue to be vital institutions for Black scholars, offering not only academic excellence but also a transformative and empowering experience. The impact of HBCUs goes beyond the individual student, influencing communities and society at large by producing educated and engaged individuals who contribute to the advancement of knowledge, equality, and social progress.
