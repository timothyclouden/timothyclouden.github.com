<h1>WHAT IS AN HBCU?</h1>
<p>The word HBCU stands for a Historically Black College and University. As the Civil war ended and Jim Crow began the formerly enslaved Africans had to build and live in their own right. During the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th,most  HBCUs were formed to provide undergraduate and graduate level education to African Americans. Education was denied to African Americans at private and public white institutions of higher learning even with specific legislation. HBCUs were created as a place for African Americans to learn the truth about themselves, their history, and strive to be an innovator of black excellence.</p>

<p>Throughout the years HBCUs have faced many of life’s challenges such as inadequate funding, accreditation issues, and even Jim Crow. However, HBCUs stood as a symbol of Hope and perseverance on the front lines of justice concerning rights among African Americans. The goal of a HBCU is to create, nurture, and produce African community leaders. Overtime, HBCUs have become the center of culture, and the standard for greatness. </p>

<p>The culture is a combination of fashion, food, language, and history. Each HBCU has a history unique to the needs of the black people in that community and manifests to an experience that can only be gained in their special light. This produces traditions like fried chicken wednesday, a day all HBCUs honor for us to join and bond over across the board. The fashion produced by school pride emphasizes the illustrious culture many attempt to emulate for example, a FAMU game day! HBCUs are where black culture thrives and paves the way for the forward movement of the black community in a place safe to be unapologetically black!

<p>Greetings I am Taylor Williams, a second-year construction engineering technology major from Jacksonville, FL. I was born in Daytona and spent the first few years of my life there while my mom completed nursing school at Bethune Cookman College then my family moved back to Jacksonville. My parents aren't from America so I didn't get to experience growing up with all of my family near and having close relationships with them. Even though I am not that close with my extended family I have two sisters (one older and one younger than me) that I couldn't imagine my life without. Growing up my parents really emphasized how important family is.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2021 and got accepted into summer B a month and a half before it started but I realized that it wasn't the best option for me at the time so I instead took a gap year. That gap year taught me that a college degree would take me way further in life and by the start of 2022 I was accepted into Famu for the upcoming school year. My gap year also gave me a taste of what being an actual adult is like and I was not equipped at all to just jump into adulthood head first. Sometimes when you have people telling you something you have to go find out for yourself what they were warning you about.</p>

<p>When getting to know you people always ask "What are your hobbies?" and I sometimes get stopped up on this question. Not because I don't have any hobbies for real it's more or so because I feel as if I haven't really found my niche yet. I've tried many things but nothing has really caught and kept my attention yet and I've tried a plethora of new things like photography, making jewelry, and even crocheting nothing has seemed to stick with me. I just try to look at it like you may have not found it yet but you still have the rest of your life to figure it out.</p>

<p>My name is Autumn Goffigan, and I am a student here at The Florida Agricultural Mechanical University. I am a Senior Scholar in Psychology with a minor in Informational Technology. My hometown is Panama City, Florida. However, I grew up as a military child. My father’s occupation has allowed me to be born in Alaska and live in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New York, and DC.</p>

<p>During the week, I work for Rethink Energy Florida as a youth education coordinator. Therefore, I create STEM curriculum that is paired with hands-on science activities. Then, I teach these lessons to Leon County elementary schoolers after school. During the summer, we also host summer camps for summer-long learning for underserved children in the community. I also work with the Tallahassee Food Network to help the 32304 community with various community projects.</p>

<p>Attending FAMU and working within the Tallahassee community has allowed me to grow as a person. A year ago, I transferred from Xavier of Louisiana, and it was the best decision I could have ever made. Coming to FAMU, I decided to get involved, and it has led me to special positions and opportunities. Such as finding the UBUNTU club and expanding my knowledge of African liberation and customs. Which led me to become Undergrad Vice President of the Association of Black Psychologists. As well as grasp once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for brand partnerships. During the Famu homecoming festival and Welcome week, I had the privilege of working for COACH and P&G as a brand ambassador on campus.</p>

	<div class="column right">
<p>I am Cassandra White a third year computer science major. I was born in Yokosuka Japan, to two loving parents. I moved to the states when I was 2 years old. My dad was in the military so while my mom and the kids were in California, my dad was in Panama CIty Beach getting our new home ready. When I was little and living on the navy base I had no idea what the rest of the world was like. It was interesting that after my dad retired there was more to life than being on base.</p>

<p>Since my dad retired we later got a house on the beach and it was the best place I have ever lived. That is where I learned I loved the water and fishing and swimming. My dad was my brother's basketball coach so we still got to travel all around the area. Every weekend we were someplace new. It was fun for me. I got to hangout with all the moms, and since I was the only girl they would take me shopping and out to adventure parks. My childhood was filled with very loving memories from all these mothers alone. Ofcourse none of them compare to my mother.</p>

<p>Now my parents live in Japan and I am on my own. I work two jobs and go to school full time. I try to always make time for my friends and myself though so I don’t go insane. I very much enjoy eating burgers and hanging out with my friends. As a computer science major, I sometimes feel like I'm decoding the mysteries of the digital world, one byte at a time. On weekends, you might catch me attempting to teach my pet goldfish how to code—it's a work in progress. And who knows, maybe one day I'll develop a groundbreaking app that combines my love for burgers, beach vibes, and underwater coding sessions.</p>

<p>My name is Kaliyah Lendore and I'm a sophomore, first year student here at FAMU. I am originally from Boston, Massachusetts and have been living there most of my life. My major is computer science and it suits me well based on my interest in technology. Since I love the internet and realized how important it was to live comfortably in modern day society I figured that this would be the perfect major choice for me to have a longlife career in. Academically I would say my biggest strength would be my note taking skills, and also my attention to detail. My weakness would probably be time management skills but that has improved tremendously compared to previous years in my school journey.</p>

<p>I am the middle child of three.My whole family is Trinidadian and the culture really defines us. I have visited places all around including Canada, New York, and Trinidad. I have a lot of family residing in these places. I am a big traveling person because I love seeing different places and going outside of Massachussetes. I always felt like it's so important and such a good thing to travel and make as many memories as you can before your time comes.</p>

<p>A life goal that I have would probably be to work a job that pays well and involves technology in a funner way that is more enjoyable for me. Apart from that I also would like to keep up with some of my favorite hobbies forever which include stepping and dancing.These activities really define my personality and show who I am as a person for people who don't know me.I plan to have a successful career that can help others, while still enjoying my favorite hobbies.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="column right">
<p>I came into this world on September 11th, 2002, in the vibrant city of Tampa, Florida. From a young age, I was pretty introverted, finding solace and inspiration in books and the wonders of science. My school years were marked by academic excellence, but I never quite fit into the typical sports or clubs when I was in middle school. My journey took an unexpected twist when I enrolled in a performing arts high school. Here, I uncovered a hidden passion for music that would shape my life in unforeseen ways. Initially, I began my musical journey by playing the cello at Blake Highschool, but it was the world of percussion that truly captured my heart. Joining the drumline ignited my musical passion, and I quickly excelled in that.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and I'm a proud student at Florida A&M University (FAMU), where I'm pursuing a degree in information technology with a clear vision of becoming a front-end developer. My time at FAMU has not only propelled my academic aspirations but has also ignited newfound passions. Dance, in particular, has emerged as a powerful creative outlet for me. I've discovered a deep connection to movement and expression through dance, and it has become an integral part of my identity. Music, which has been a constant in my life since high school, continues to inspire and drive me. Additionally, my commitment to physical fitness and regular workouts has strengthened, contributing to my holistic well-being.</p>

<p>As I continue my journey at FAMU, Im excited for the adventures and opportunities that lie ahead, embracing the evolving path with open arms.</p>
