	<div id= "exp">

<h3>Why is attending an HBCU so important</h3>
<p>HBCU colleges are a whole lot different than your average University. Historically black colleges offer a lot of diversity among campus students that you can not find anywhere else. There is also lots of cool Organizations to get involved in that include things Such as dancing, stepping, giving back to the community and plenty of sisterhood or brotherhood. The community here on a HBCU campus is very inviting and inclusive, where this is a spot that everyone(no matter your hobbies or interest) can feel like they belong. This energy is what the appeal is all about and what motivates so many people to come to an HBCU school to get their education.
</p>
<h3>What Makes the Experience so Different</h3>
<p>At All HBCU schools, there is much more different types of Culture clubs available to students from all different backgrounds. This creates a safe environment to be yourself and bond with new people. Some examples of this might be a Caribbean club or a Haitian club. A lot of classes and extracurricular activities are tailored to African American culture and a lot of Students enjoy feeling included. Not to mention there are very great schools with some of the most top notch education such as Spelman College or Howard University. Graduation rate was reported to be high and also students maintained a decent GPA. There is over 100 HBCU schools in America created with the intent of providing equal education for black folks. In the earlier years black people did not have equal education opportunities or the best schooling. These campuses were built  to defeat all of this and help uplift the black community with a safe space and good education to help them prevail in life.</p>
<p>Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play a pivotal role in shaping the educational experiences of students, fostering a unique and vibrant university life. HBCUs have a rich history rooted in providing higher education opportunities for African Americans when racial segregation and discrimination limited access to mainstream institutions. Today, these institutions continue to be pillars of academic excellence, cultural preservation, and community engagement.

<p>University life at an HBCU is characterized by a strong sense of community and a supportive environment. These institutions often have smaller student populations compared to larger universities, allowing for close-knit relationships between students, faculty, and staff. The camaraderie among students is a hallmark of HBCU life, creating a family-like atmosphere where everyone is encouraged to succeed and uplift one another.</p>

<p>HBCU campuses are known for their vibrant cultural events, celebrations, and traditions that showcase the rich heritage of African Americans. Homecoming celebrations, step shows, and Greek life are integral parts of the HBCU experience, fostering a sense of pride and unity. The emphasis on cultural awareness and social justice issues also permeates the academic curriculum, with many HBCUs incorporating discussions on race, identity, and equality into their programs.</p>

<p> Moreover, HBCUs often have dedicated support services to address the unique needs of their student body. These services may include mentoring programs, tutoring, and career development resources, all aimed at ensuring students not only excel academically but also transition successfully into their professional lives. The commitment to nurturing well-rounded individuals is reflected in the diverse range of extracurricular activities, from academic clubs to performing arts groups.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the university life at an HBCU is a dynamic and enriching experience, where students are not only academically challenged but also empowered to embrace their cultural heritage and contribute meaningfully to society. The supportive community, cultural celebrations, and academic rigor make HBCUs a distinctive and cherished part of the higher education landscape.</p>
